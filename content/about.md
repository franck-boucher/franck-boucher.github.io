I am a web developer and I live in France 🇫🇷 🥖

### About me

I began to develop in 2010 for no particular reason but the curiosity to know how a software is built and find out if I could build any too.

In 2014, it was pretty clear I was having too much fun building web pages to specialize myself in something else than web development, so I did. And here I am, more than ten years later, still passionate about it 🚀.

### As a developer, here are my core values

**🧠 Hungry for knowledge**  
One of the reasons I love my job is because I am always learning. The world of web development is continuously evolving so fast, and keeping my self up to date with the latest trends is so much fun.

**👌 Designing the perfect implementation for user's needs**  
This goes from modeling the right data models to a well thought out UI and UX. And it all starts with a good understanding of what the user needs, which might not be what he says he wants.

**😁 Benevolence**  
Being friendly and working with friendly people is a requirement for me. I love my job, I love programming, I love going to work! I will always try to bring the best of myself and inspire my team to do the same.
