The world of web development is continuously evolving so fast, and keeping my self up to date with the latest trends is so much fun.\n👌 Designing the perfect implementation for user\u0026rsquo;s needs\nThis goes from modeling the right data models to a well thought out UI and UX. And it all starts with a good understanding of what the user needs, which might not be what he says he wants.\n😁 Benevolence\nBeing friendly and working with friendly people is a requirement for me.
