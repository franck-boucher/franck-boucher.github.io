      <description>I am a web developer and I live in France 🇫🇷 🥖
About me I began to develop in 2010 for no particular reason but the curiosity to know how a software is built and find out if I could build any too.
In 2014, it was pretty clear I was having too much fun building web pages to specialize myself in something else than web development, so I did. And here I am, more than ten years later, still passionate about it 🚀.</description>
