      <description>Hi I am Franck, a web developer.
I am in the web development because it evolves fast and there is so much to learn. I keep myself up to date with the new trends and technologies, but I know how to put aside my eagerness to make wise decisions for companies and their real use cases.
I studied computer science at Nice Sophia-Antipolis University and speaks English and French. I love building tech from PCs to mechanical keyboards, and PC gaming.</description>
